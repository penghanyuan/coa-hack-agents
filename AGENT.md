## Image Gallery Card Implementation

### Overview
Implemented an image gallery card feature for the CopilotKit page that allows users to create and display multiple image galleries with captions through natural language chat interactions.

### Key Features Added

#### 1. Image Gallery Data Structure
- **Interface**: `ImageGalleryCard`
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each gallery
  - `title`: Gallery title/heading
  - `images`: Array of image objects with `url` and `caption` properties

#### 2. New CopilotKit Action
- **Action Name**: `createImageGallery`
- **Purpose**: Creates image gallery cards through chat interactions
- **Parameters**:
  - `title` (string, required): The gallery title
  - `images` (object[], required): Array of image objects with url and caption
- **Handler**: Adds new gallery to state with unique ID

#### 3. UI Components

##### Gallery Display
- **Layout**: Responsive grid system (1/2/3 columns based on screen size)
- **Image Cards**: Each image has:
  - Fixed height (192px) with object-cover for consistent appearance
  - Caption text below each image
  - Semi-transparent background overlay
  - Error handling with placeholder fallback

##### Interactive Features
- **Delete Galleries**: Hover-activated delete button for each gallery
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Scrollable Layout**: Added overflow-y-auto for vertical scrolling

#### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- **Chat Suggestions**: Updated to include image gallery creation options
- **Readable Data**: Gallery data exposed to CopilotKit for context awareness
- **Empty States**: Proper messaging when no content exists
- **Error Handling**: Fallback images for broken URLs using placeholder service

#### 5. Visual Improvements
- **Container Size**: Increased max-width to 4xl for better gallery display
- **Section Organization**: Clear separation between galleries and proverbs
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth transitions and visual feedback
- **Typography**: Proper heading hierarchy and text styling

### Technical Implementation Details

#### State Management
```typescript
const [imageGalleries, setImageGalleries] = useState<ImageGalleryCard[]>([]);
```

#### CopilotKit Integration
- Added `useCopilotReadable` for gallery data exposure
- Integrated with chat suggestions for discoverability
- Proper parameter validation and type safety

#### Responsive Design
- CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints

### Usage Examples
Users can now interact with the assistant using natural language like:
- "Create an image gallery about travel destinations"
- "Add an image gallery for food recipes"
- "Show me a gallery of nature photos"

The assistant will automatically generate appropriate image galleries with relevant placeholder images and captions based on the requested topic.

### Error Handling
- Image load failures automatically fallback to placeholder images
- Type-safe parameter handling
- Graceful state updates with proper error boundaries

### Future Enhancements
